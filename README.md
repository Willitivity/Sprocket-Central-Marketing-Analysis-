**A KPMG Data Analytics Internship**

## INTRODUCTION 
Recently, I completed the KPMG Virtual Data Analytics
Internship. It was a fantastic opportunity for me to work and learn from the world’s
leading organization and build the skills required to excel as a Data Analyst.

During this intense and exciting program, I worked as a Data Analyst Consultant for
KPMG’s Lighthouse and Innovation Team.

𝙈𝙮 𝙍𝙤𝙡𝙚
My role in the team is to use my data analytics skills to help clients ensure that their
data is ready for analysis by performing data quality assessments, providing
structure for data analysis, performing analysis, presenting findings to stakeholders,
and making recommendations for data-driven decision-making.

𝙏𝙝𝙚 𝘾𝙡𝙞𝙚𝙣𝙩
Our client is Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a medium-sized bike and cycling 
accessories-selling company based in Australia.

𝙏𝙝𝙚 𝙏𝙖𝙨𝙠
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd wants to organize a marketing campaign targeting its high-profile customers. The company has a large dataset relating to its customers, but the team is unsure how to make the best out of the data. The company, therefore, needs our help to analyze the datasets and provide insights and recommendations to optimize its marketing strategy.

Before we continue….

Now we have gotten that out of the way, let us proceed….

## PROBLEM STATEMENT 
Sprocket is looking to boost business by analyzing existing customer datasets to
determine customer trends and behavior. To help with this, I need to;
* Identify all data quality issues in the datasets.
* Create a PowerPoint presentation to outline the approach to be taken in the 
whole analysis task.
* Who are the top 1000 customers Sprocket should target in the marketing
campaign?

## Tools Used
To transform, analyze, and provide insights and recommendations, I used the following tools;
* Microsoft Excel
* Microsoft PowerPoint
* Power Query
* Power Pivot

## Skills Demonstrated 
* Data Manipulation and Transformation.
* Data Analysis and Interpretation
* Formulas and Functions (IFS, COUNTIFS, SUMIFS, VLOOKUP, TRUNC, TEXT)
* Pivot Table Analyzers
* Filters and Slicers used in Excel.

## The Datasets
Our client, Sprocket, provided us with three datasets for the analysis. The work on these datasets will be in three phases which will cover the modules in the internship which are;
* Data Quality Assessment
* Data Insights
* Data Insights Presentation
The Dataset comprises of;
* CustomerAddress
* CustomerDemographic
* Transactions

## DATA EXPLORATION, CLEANING AND TRANSFORMATION
I explored the datasets and carried out a preliminary data exploration to assess the
data quality and identify inconsistencies and outliers in the datasets. These issues
form the base of our data cleaning and transformation.
The table below outlines the data quality issues.

The CustomerDemographic dataset has 13 columns and 4000 rows. This dataset
specifies information concerning the customers under the following headers;
customer_id, first_name, last_name, gender, past_3_years_bike_related_purchases, DOB, job_title, job_industry_category,
wealth_segment, deceased_indicator, default, owns_car, tenure.

𝘾𝙪𝙨𝙩𝙤𝙢𝙚𝙧 𝘼𝙙𝙙𝙧𝙚𝙨𝙨
This dataset contains six columns specifying information about customers under the following headers; customer_id, address, postcode, state, country, and
property_valuation.

𝙏𝙧𝙖𝙣𝙨𝙖𝙘𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣𝙨
The Transaction dataset contains information about transactions for the year .
It contains 13 columns and 20,000 rows. The headers are; transaction_id,
product_id, customer_id, transaction_date, online_order, order_status, brand,
product_line, product_class, product_size, list_price, standard_cost, product_first_sold_date.

## DATA TRANSFORMATION 
To perform the analysis and draw accurate insights from the datasets provided.
New columns were generated in the datasets where they are required. This was
done using specialized Excel functions and formulas.

𝘾𝙪𝙨𝙩𝙤𝙢𝙚𝙧 𝘿𝙚𝙢𝙤𝙜𝙧𝙖𝙥𝙝𝙞𝙘;
* 𝘼𝙙𝙙𝙚𝙙 𝙖𝙜𝙚 𝙘𝙤𝙡𝙪𝙢𝙣
I did this using the “𝙏𝙍𝙐𝙉𝘾” function. This function uses the DOB column to
calculate Age. The addition of the Age will help me to group the customers into
various age groups for the analysis.

𝙏𝙧𝙖𝙣𝙨𝙖𝙘𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣𝙨; 
* 𝘼𝙙𝙙𝙚𝙙 𝙢𝙤𝙣𝙩𝙝 𝙘𝙤𝙡𝙪𝙢𝙣 
This was achieved using the “𝙏𝙀𝙓𝙏” function. It generates the month from the date in a specified column. A month column makes it easy to analyze transactions by month and identify the month(s) with the highest or lowest transactions.

* 𝘼𝙙𝙙𝙚𝙙 𝙥𝙧𝙤𝙛𝙞𝙩 𝙘𝙤𝙡𝙪𝙢𝙣 
The profit was added by subtracting the standard cost from the list price. The profit column makes it easier in the analysis to identify products, customers, state, and months that generates the most and least profit.

* 𝘼𝙙𝙙𝙚𝙙 𝙨𝙤𝙢𝙚 𝙘𝙤𝙡𝙪𝙢𝙣𝙨 𝙛𝙧𝙤𝙢 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙘𝙪𝙨𝙩𝙤𝙢𝙚𝙧 𝙙𝙚𝙢𝙤𝙜𝙧𝙖𝙥𝙝𝙞𝙘 𝙙𝙖𝙩𝙖𝙨𝙚𝙩 
For the sake of the analysis, some columns were added from the customer demographic dataset to the transactions dataset. I did this by employing the Excel “𝙑𝙇𝙊𝙊𝙆𝙐𝙋” function.

## ANALYSIS AND INSIGHTS 
The next task stage is analyzing and providing insights from the data. To perform analysis and draw insights Pivot Tables were used for the analysis.
The analysis was completed, and results were presented in a dashboard which will
be sent to the client.

### DASHBOARD 
![](https://github.com/Willitivity/Sprocket-Central-Marketing-Analysis-/blob/main/Sprocket%20Central%20Dashboard.png)

## INSIGHTS 
The results obtained from the analysis were broken down to obtain the following 
insights.
* Customers from the manufacturing and financial sectors have been the company’s
most outstanding contributors to sales volume. They also bring in the highest profits, with over $4m for the business.
* The mass customer segment is the most profitable, and the age group of 38 - 47 is the most profitable age group for the company.
* New South Wales customers contributed the most to the company’s sales volume.
* There are also more female customers than males, making up 53% of the customer-base.

## RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONCLUSION 
From the insights provided by the analysis, the marketing team will mainly optimize sales performance and profits by taking the following actions.
* Customers in the financial services, health, and manufacturing sectors residing in New South Wales and Victoria should be highly prioritized.
* Customers aged between 38 - 47 and are in the mass customer segment should
also be highly considered and sold to, as they have the best chance of bringing in profits, improved sales, and expansion.
* A pretty good number of the highly valued customers will be female.
